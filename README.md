# File_Sorting

This project uses SQL, for the database. The uniqueness of this project is that for file uploads, every file uploaded is stored on the database as the user's first and last name no matter how the filename is stored. This would help in sorting out the files on the database when an admin is faced with a lot of data but wants to find only a selected number of file uploads made by specific users.
